            Throughout history mushrooms have gained many varying reputations,
            considered both food and foe. Today it is easy for us to find safe,
            tasty mushrooms at the grocery store, but it wasnt always this way.
            Over the years reckless mushroom hunters have thrown caution to the
            wind with sometimes fatal results, giving food-safe mushrooms a bad
            reputation. Its resulted in two very different categories of
            peoplemycophiles (those who love mushrooms) and mycophobes (those
            who fear mushrooms). Then there are folks like me, who fall
            somewhere between adoration and trepidation. I enjoy mushrooms, but
            Ive heard enough horror stories about them to be cautious; you wont
            see me hunting for wild mushrooms without an expert guide by my
            side. As weve familiarized ourselves with their many different
            species, mushrooms have become less forbidding. With the recent
            focus on locally sourced food and foraging, the allure of the
            mushroom doesnt seem to be slowing down. If anything, mushrooms are
            now more popular than ever.

            Mushrooms are often lumped into the vegetable category, though most
            of us know that they are actually a fungus. Today the most commonly
            consumed variety is the button mushroom, or Agaricus bisporus, which
            makes up about 40 percent of the mushrooms grown around the world.
            The name mushroom has been given to over 38,000 varieties of fungus
            that possess the same threadlike roots and cap. These threads,
            sometimes referred to as gills, are responsible for giving mushrooms
            like portobellos their meaty taste and texture. As air passes
            through the threads moisture evaporates, giving the mushroom a rich
            heartiness you can really sink your teeth into.

            A great deal of the mystery surrounding mushrooms stems from their
            association with poisonings and accidental deaths. The famous French
            philosopher Voltaire was once quoted as saying, A dish of mushrooms
            changed the destiny of Europe. He was referring to the War of
            Austrian Succession that followed the death of Holy Roman Emperor
            King Charles VI. The kings untimely demise may have been a result of
            eating amanita, or death cap, mushrooms. On the other hand,
            mushrooms have also been praised for their medicinal properties
            thanks to their heavy dose of protein, potassium and
            polysaccharides, which contribute to healthy immune function.

            Of course, you cant have a conversation about mushrooms without
            touching on the intoxicating variety. Though we may associate
            hallucinogenic mushrooms with the culture of the 1960s,
            archaeological evidence suggests that these types of mushrooms
            served religious and spiritual purposes centuries earlier. Siberian
            shamans and Vikings are believed to have consumed hallucinogenic fly
            agaric (Amanita muscaria) mushrooms during religious ceremonies.
            According to the Mixtec Vienna Codex (13-15 centuries AD),
            mind-altering mushrooms were used in religious ceremonies in ancient
            Mexico. Roman Catholic priests also observed and recorded the
            consumption of hallucinogenic mushrooms by native peoples after the
            conquest of Mexico in 1519. After the effects of the mushrooms had
            worn off, the natives would discuss their visions of the future. We
            now know that these effects were not caused by magic, but rather by
            the psilocybin and psilocin found in some mushrooms.

            For centuries relatively little was known about mushrooms, and for a
            long time the Eastern half of the world was considered mostly
            mycophilic, and the West mycophobic. This all changed when the
            French introduced mushrooms into their haute cuisine. It wasnt long
            before the rest of the world began to embrace the mushroom. By the
            late 19th century, Americans were cooking up mushrooms in their own
            kitchens. Prior to this time, mushrooms were mainly reserved for use
            in condiments. Inspired by the French, Americans took mushrooms to a
            whole new level of devotion. Clubs dedicated to foraging,
            identifying and cooking various varieties of fungi began popping up
            all over the country. Even today, locally foraged mushrooms are
            worth their weight in gold just ask any mushroom hunter in search of
            morels after a spring rain shower.

            If there is a crown jewel in the realm of fungi, it is the truffle.
            Referred to as the diamond of the kitchen by famous French
            gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, truffles are one of the
            most expensive foods in the world. They grow near tree roots, most
            often oak, hazel, beech and chestnut, about 3-12 inches below
            ground. They are sniffed out by dogs and pigs that have been trained
            to recognize the truffles distinct odor. Once a truffle has been
            located, the trufficulteur (truffle farmer) will very carefully
            clean the surrounding area to check for ripeness. It is important to
            never touch the truffle with your bare hands, as this can cause the
            precious fungi to rot. If the truffle is not yet ripe for the
            picking, it is recovered and left to reach maturity. This long and
            labor-intensive process is the reason behind the hefty price tag.

            As Americas interest in mushrooms grew, entire cookbooks were
            devoted to them. One of the first English language mushroom
            cookbooks is Kate Sargeants One Hundred Mushroom Receipts (1899).
            Sargeants work includes some fabulous Harry Potter-sounding recipe
            titles including Coprinus Comatus Soup (Shaggy Mane), Lepiota
            Procera Stew, and Baked Tricholoma Personatum. In the books
            introduction, Sargeant describes the changing American attitude
            towards mushrooms at the turn of the century: The general opinion in
            this country regarding mushrooms has been, that with one or two
            exceptions, all forms of fungus growth are either poisonous or
            unwholesome, but it is very gratifying to observe the change that is
            rapidly taking place in the public mind. Soon public opinion will
            acknowledge that it is an established fact that the great majority
            of the larger funguses, especially of those that grow in fields and
            other open places, is [sic] not only wholesome but highly
            nutritious. – Kate Sargeant, One Hundred Mushroom Receipts (1899)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Sargeant also acknowledges the mushrooms status as the meatiest of
            vegetables, noting that the butcher bill would surely decrease if we
            would replace some of our meat entrees with mushroom preparations.
            It seems Sargeant was ahead of her time; today many vegetarians
            replace the beef in their hamburgers with a seasoned, roasted
            portobello cap.

            Some of the earliest American mushroom recipe preparations were for
            mushrooms baked on toast in cream sauce. In Studies of American
            Fungi (1911), Sarah Tyson Rorer suggests baking the mushroom under a
            glass bell. The bell was then lifted at the dinner table so that the
            eater may get the full aroma and flavor from the mushrooms. If youd
            like to make a similar vintage mushroom recipe, with or without the
            glass bell, try this one from Cooking Club Magazine, published in
            February 1908. It was printed not long after Americans jumped on the
            mushroom bandwagon!
